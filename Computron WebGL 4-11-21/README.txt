Most web browsers do not support running this build locally. In order to run the WebGL version, you can download a local web server app and run it that way.

One example can be found at https://github.com/greggman/servez/releases/tag/v1.8.0
and follows these steps:

1. Run Servez.Setup.1.8.0.exe if you are on Windows, Servez-1.8.0.dmg if you are on Mac, or Servez-1.8.0.AppImage if on Linux. 
   Servez, a program for running a local server, will install and run.
2. Navigate to this build folder in the File to Serve area.
3. Click start to start the local server.
4. Select Launch Browser, then select your browser.
5. You can now play this WebGL build of Computron 2.0.

I do not own Servez. All rights to Servez go to greggman.
